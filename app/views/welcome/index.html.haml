          After receiving an MSME
          %a{rel: 'tooltip', title: "Master's in Mechanical Engineering"} (?)
          from Stanford, I co-founded Quixplore
          with my friend, Nic Hippenmeyer. We began with the huge challenge of trying to bring all of the great things
          happening in the world to one place, and we created a pretty cool web app for sharing local events.

          As product designer, I've picked up some design chops, learned front-end engineering and Ruby
          on Rails, and feel like I could write a book on start-up interaction design 'do's and 'don't's. Now, I'm
          looking for the next big challenge. Check out some of my design work below.

        %h2 Quixplore
        Quixplore is a shared social calendar for your friends and followers.
        Our goal is to give people and organizations a single place to share their plans and ideas for things to do. We
        have found that most people email and text to share these things with friends, so we built a platform
        that leverages location and time to make both sharing and discovery a more intuitive process.

        This has been my full-time job for the past year and something I am still very passionate about working on.
        Please take the opportunity to check out the site and sign up to join. You'll be able to see how I've
        handled a variety of design challenges and hopefully enjoy trying it out in the process.

        Some examples of vector icons I've made for various projects - if you feel that any of them (or
        something similar) might be a useful addition to one of your projects, I'd be happy to share the full file or
        make a new one to suit your needs.
